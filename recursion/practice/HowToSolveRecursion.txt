1) Identify if you can break problem in smaller problem.
2) Write the recurrence relation if needed.
3) Draw the recursive tree.
4) About the tree:
    - See the flow of function. How they are getting in stack?
    - Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
    - Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper,
    - Wse a debugger to the flow.
6) See how the values and what type of  are returned at each step. See where
   the function will come out. In the end you will come out of the main function.
7) The variables:
    - The variables that are needed to be passed to the next recursive function
      call, put them in the parameter of the function.
      EX - start and end pointer in BinarySearchRecursion.
    - The variable that only used inside a recursive function and don't need to
      be passed on the future recursion calls, put that in body of the function.
      EX - Mid pointer variable in BinarySearchRecursion.

8) Make sure to return the result of a function call of the return type.

7) No one can explain Recursion to you, if you are not using pen and paper.
